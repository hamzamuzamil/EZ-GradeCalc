## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Security Functions
```typescript
// Input sanitization
const sanitizeInput = (input: string): string => {
  return input.replace(/[<>\"'&]/g, '').trim()
}

// Safe number validation
const validatePercentage = (value: number): boolean => {
  return !isNaN(value) && isFinite(value) && value >= 0 && value <= 100
}
```

### 2. Performance Optimizations
```typescript
// Debounced calculations
const debouncedCalculate = useCallback(
  debounce((total: string, wrong: string) => {
    // Calculation logic
  }, 300),
  []
)

// Memoized expensive operations
const chartData = useMemo(() => {
  // Chart generation logic
}, [dependencies])
```

### 3. Responsive Design Patterns
```typescript
// Mobile-first responsive classes
className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl"
className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3"
className="p-3 sm:p-4 lg:p-6"
